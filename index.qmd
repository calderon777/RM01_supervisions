## Welcome

Welcome to these interactive laboratory sessions for **Research Methods in Land Economy**. This digital workbook provides hands-on experience with R programming, quantitative analysis, and data visualisation techniques essential for contemporary research in land economy, finance, planning, and environmental housing studies.

## Supervisions Overview

These supervised laboratory sessions are designed for MPhil students beginning their quantitative research journey. Over several progressive supervision, you will develop from complete programming novice to confident data analysis skills, working with appropriate real-world land economy datasets from institutional sources and applying cutting-edge analytical techniques to substantive research questions in your field.

### Academic Integration
Each lab connects technical skill development with substantive research applications, ensuring that programming competency serves your broader academic and professional objectives. You'll work with datasets relevant to housing policy, regional development, and planning analysis while developing reproducible research workflows used in leading academic institutions and policy organisations.

### How to Use This Interactive Workbook

This workbook is designed as a **practical, hands-on learning experience** that requires active engagement with both the content and your RStudio environment. Success depends on following the structured approach outlined below.

### Essential Setup

#### Technical Requirements
Before beginning, ensure you have:
- **R** (version â‰¥ 4.3) installed from [r-project.org](https://www.r-project.org/)
- **RStudio Desktop** (latest version) from [posit.co](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/)
- A stable internet connection for package installation and data downloads
- Sufficient disk space (â‰¥ 2GB) for datasets and outputs

#### ðŸ’¾ Install R and RStudio on your laptops/gadgets

RStudio is a wrapper for R; we are using RStudio because it makes looks R more organised and straightforward. Follow the following instructions:

- go to https://www.r-project.org

- click on 'CRAN mirror'

- choose one of the two UK mirrors - https://www.stats.bris.ac.uk/R/ or https://cran.ma.imperial.ac.uk/

- Click on 'Download R for Windows' or 'Download R for macOS'

- Click on 'install R for the first time

- Click on 'Download R-... for Windows', the current version is R-4.5.1. Or alternatively, download the executable file for macOS. 

- double-click the downloaded file, then click on 'Run', 'language:English', 'OK', and read and follow the instructions of installation until you click on 'Next' for installing and 'Finish'

Then proceed to Installing RStudio.

- Go to rstudio.com

- click on 'download'

- download the Free version, download RStudio for Windows or macOS

- Click on 'Next' if you agree and on 'Install' and 'Finish' to complete the process.


#### Project Organisation
Create a dedicated folder structure for the course:
```
RM01_Labs/
â”œâ”€â”€ data/           # Raw datasets and imports
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/        # Your R code files  
â”œâ”€â”€ outputs/        # Generated plots, tables, reports
â”œâ”€â”€ certificates/   # Professional development documentation
â””â”€â”€ reflections/    # Written responses to critical questions
```

### Active Learning Protocol

#### 1. **Read â†’ Code â†’ Reflect**
Each lab section follows this essential pattern:
- **Read** the contextual material and instructions carefully
- **Code** by replicating all examples in your RStudio session
- **Reflect** by answering critical thinking questions in writing

#### 2. **Hands-On Replication**
**Critical:** Do not simply read the code examples. You must:
- Type (don't copy-paste) all code into RStudio scripts
- Execute each code block and verify the outputs
- Experiment with variations and modifications
- Debug any errors before proceeding

#### 3. **Documentation Standards**
Maintain professional documentation practices:
- Save each lab as a separate R script (e.g., `lab01_certification.R`)
- Comment your code extensively using `# explanatory text`
- Include session information
- Date and version your files systematically


### Deliverables

Each lab includes specific deliverables:
- **Technical:** Working R scripts with documented code
- **Visual:** Publication-quality plots and analytical outputs  
- **Written:** Responses to all critical reflection questions
- **Professional:** Certificates, portfolios, and documentation

### Learning Support

#### Getting Help
When you encounter difficulties:
1. **Review the relevant section** carefully for missed details or typos
2. **Check R documentation** using `?function_name` or `help(function_name)`
3. **Examine error messages** systematicallyâ€”they often provide clear guidance and AI can often provide answers
4. **Consult peers** through appropriate academic channels
5. **Attend supervision sessions** prepared with specific questions

#### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Passive learning:** You must complete the materials before attending the face-to-face supervisions.
- **Passive reading:** You must actively code to learn programming
- **Copy-paste coding:** Type examples yourself to build muscle memory
- **Ignoring errors:** Always resolve issues before proceeding
- **Superficial reflections:** Engage deeply with methodological questions
- **Poor organisation:** Maintain systematic file and folder structures

#### Industry Applications
R programming competency is increasingly valued in:
- **Policy Analysis:** Government departments and think tanks
- **Consultancy:** Urban planning, housing, and development firms
- **Research Organisations:** Academic institutions and policy institutes
- **Data Science:** Emerging opportunities across multiple sectors

### Technical Notes
Labs will introduce packages progressively. Install required packages as indicated in each session, and maintain a record of your technical environment using:
```r
# Document your session for reproducibility
sessionInfo()
```

### Getting Started

Navigate to **Supervision 1** using the link to begin your journey into R programming for land economy research. Remember: this is an interactive learning experience that requires preparation before attending supervisions, your active participation, critical thinking, and professional engagement.

**Success in these labs depends not just on following instructions, but on developing the analytical thinking skills that will serve your research skills.**
