# 🧭 Session Overview

**Prerequisites:** 
- Platform skills: Qualtrics, Prolific/MTurk, consent flows

**Purpose:** Bridge from distributing surveys to designing questions that elicit valid, credible qualitative data_, especially on potentially sensitive topics. This supervision emphasizes **qualitative research approaches** within survey design.

**Key Transition:** You now know *how* to build and deploy a survey. Today we focus on *what* to ask and *how* to ask it—particularly when seeking rich, nuanced responses rather than simple numerical scales.

---

# 🎯 Learning Outcomes

By the end of this supervision, you will be able to:

1. **Distinguish** between qualitative and quantitative survey questions and identify when each approach serves your research goals
2. **Explain** why representativity matters for external validity and describe (at a high level) what survey weights do
3. **Identify and correct** common wording problems that undermine data quality:
   - Leading/loaded language
   - Double-barrelled questions
   - Ambiguous terms
   - Social desirability triggers
4. **Design** both direct and indirect elicitation strategies for sensitive topics
5. **Critically evaluate** real questionnaire items from the European Values Study (EVS) and propose improved qualitative versions
6. **Apply** these principles to your own RM01 research design

# 🧠 Learn (15 min) — How wording changes data quality

## Part 1: Mini-Lecture (15 min)

## 1.1 Qualitative vs. Quantitative Questions in Surveys

### Quantitative Approach
- **Structure:** Closed-ended, fixed response categories
- **Output:** Numerical data for statistical analysis
- **Example:** "On a scale of 1-5, how satisfied are you with...?"
- **Strength:** Comparable, analyzable at scale
- **Limitation:** May miss nuance, context, unexpected perspectives

### Qualitative Approach  
- **Structure:** Open-ended, narrative responses, or scenario-based
- **Output:** Text data requiring thematic/content analysis
- **Example:** "Describe a situation where you felt satisfied/dissatisfied..."
- **Strength:** Rich detail, unexpected insights, contextual understanding
- **Limitation:** Time-intensive to analyze; harder to generalize numerically

### When to Choose Each
- **Quantitative:** Testing hypotheses, measuring prevalence, comparing groups
- **Qualitative:** Exploring meanings, understanding processes, generating hypotheses
- **Mixed:** Often most powerful—use qualitative to inform quantitative scales or explain quantitative patterns

---

## 1.2 Representativity → External Validity

### Core Concept
**Representativity** means your sample composition resembles your **target population** on characteristics that matter for your inference.

### Why It Matters
- **Threat:** If key groups are under/over-represented, results may not generalize (external validity risk)
- **Example:** Surveying only landlords when you need tenant perspectives too
- **Real Estate Context:** Property investors vs. owner-occupiers vs. renters may have systematically different views on housing policy

### Pragmatic Reality
- Perfect representativity is unattainable
- **Goal:** Credible coverage + transparent documentation of limitations
- **Your RM01 surveys:** Consider who you're reaching via Prolific/MTurk/personal networks

---

## 1.3 Survey Weights (High-Level Understanding)

You won't compute weights in this course, but understand their purpose:

### Design Weights
- **Purpose:** Correct unequal selection probabilities from sampling design
- **Example:** If rural respondents had 1/3 the chance of selection, weight them 3× higher

### Post-Stratification Weights
- **Purpose:** After fieldwork, adjust to population benchmarks (e.g., age×sex×region)
- **Use case:** Your Prolific sample skews young? Reweight to match UK census margins
- **Limitation:** Weighting reduces certain biases but **cannot fix poor question design**

### Key Takeaway
Representative sampling + good weights help **external validity**.  
Good question design helps **internal validity** (measuring what you intend to measure).  
You need both.

## 1.4 Question Formulation Pitfalls

### Leading/Loaded Wording
❌ "Don't you agree that affordable housing is essential?"  
✅ "To what extent do you think affordable housing is important?"

### Double-Barrelled Questions
> ✅ **Heuristic:** If a question contains *and*, it is probably double‑barrelled.
❌ "How satisfied are you with your income and job security?"  
✅ Split into two questions—income satisfaction and job security are distinct constructs

### Ambiguity & Vagueness
❌ "How often do you visit properties?" (What's "often"? Personal viewings? Client viewings?)  
✅ "In the past month, approximately how many property viewings did you conduct?"

### Social Desirability Bias
- **Risk:** Respondents answer what sounds "good" rather than truthfully
- **Topics:** Income, discriminatory attitudes, rule compliance, controversial opinions
- **Strategy:** Indirect elicitation (see next section)

---

## 1.5 Sensitive Topics: Direct vs. Indirect Elicitation

### Direct Questions
- **Approach:** Straightforward, explicit
- **Example:** "Have you ever discriminated against a tenant on the basis of ethnicity?"
- **Pro:** Simple, transparent
- **Con:** Likely underreporting due to social desirability

### Indirect Approaches

#### Qualitative Techniques
1. **Third-person framing:** "How common do you think ethnic discrimination is among landlords in your area?"
2. **Projective prompts:** "Imagine a landlord who prefers not to rent to certain ethnic groups. What might their reasoning be?"
3. **Vignettes/scenarios:** Present a hypothetical situation; ask for interpretation or advice
4. **List experiments** (concept): Compare item counts between control/treatment groups to infer prevalence without individual disclosure

#### Example: Immigration Attitudes
- **Direct:** "Do you support stricter immigration controls?" (May trigger socially desirable response)
- **Indirect:** Present vignette of immigrant family seeking housing; ask open-ended: "What factors should a landlord consider when evaluating this application?"

### When to Use Indirect Methods
- Stigmatized behaviors or attitudes
- Illegal/unethical practices
- Topics where respondent may fear judgment
- Exploratory research where you want honest, detailed narratives

---

# ✏️ Try (25 min) — Rewrite a sensitive question (direct → indirect)

## Part 2: Activity A (25 min) – Rewriting Sensitive Questions

## Task Overview
Working in **pairs**, choose one sensitive theme below. For your chosen theme:

1. Draft a **direct** question (quantitative or closed-ended)
2. Draft an **indirect/qualitative** alternative using one or more of:
   - Vignette with open-ended follow-up
   - Projective/third-person framing
   - Scenario-based question
3. Compare: What kind of data would each approach yield? What are the trade-offs?

## Themes (Pick One)
> **We analyze wording and data quality — not beliefs or personal views.**

### A. Immigration & Housing
Context: Attitudes toward immigrant access to housing/social housing

### B. Regulatory Compliance
Context: Landlords' adherence to safety regulations, licensing, tax reporting

### C. Political Tolerance
Context: Acceptance of diverse political views in community/workplace

### D. Gender Norms at Work
Context: Beliefs about women in property development/construction leadership

### E. Religious Practice & Real Estate
Context: Religious considerations in property transactions, development decisions

## Deliverable
Prepare to share both versions (2 minutes per pair):
- Direct question
- Indirect alternative
- One insight about what changes between approaches

## Quality Checklist
- ✅ Neutral wording (no leading language)?
- ✅ Single construct (not double-barrelled)?
- ✅ Clear, defined terms (no ambiguous "often," "regularly")?
- ✅ Acknowledges social desirability pressure?
- ✅ Indirect version genuinely reduces pressure while still addressing topic?

# 🔎 Apply (40 min) — Audit real survey questions (EVS)

## Part 3: Activity B (40 min) – EVS Question Audit

## Overview
The European Values Study surveys thousands of respondents across Europe on values, beliefs, and attitudes. We'll audit how EVS handles sensitive/complex topics and consider qualitative improvements.

## Step 1: Form Groups & Choose Subtopic (5 min)

**Groups of 3–5.** Each group selects **one subtopic**:

1. **Religion & Morality** (e.g., items on religiosity, moral absolutes)
2. **Family & Gender Equality** (e.g., women's roles, work-family balance)
3. **Politics, Democracy & Trust** (e.g., institutional trust, political engagement)
4. **National Identity, Migration & Diversity** (e.g., immigration attitudes, national pride)
5. **Work, Economy & Inequality** (e.g., income fairness, job values)
6. **Environment & Climate Attitudes** (e.g., willingness to sacrifice for environment)

## Step 2: Locate & Select Items (10 min)

1. Open the **EVS 2017 Master Questionnaire** (link above)
2. Find the section(s) relevant to your subtopic
3. Select **2–3 items** (not 3–5—we're prioritizing depth over breadth)
4. Screenshot or note item codes for reference

## Step 3: Analyze Each Item (15 min)

For each selected item, consider:

### Wording Analysis
- Is language neutral or leading/loaded?
- Any double-barrelled issues (two concepts in one question)?
- Are terms clearly defined or ambiguous?

### Elicitation Strategy
- Direct or indirect approach?
- What assumptions does the question make?
- What might respondents be reluctant to reveal?

### Response Format
- Closed scales (e.g., 1–10, agree/disagree)?
- Does the format constrain nuanced responses?
- Would open-ended follow-ups add value?

### Qualitative Potential
- How might you reframe this as an open-ended question?
- Could a vignette or scenario elicit richer data?
- Would third-person framing reduce social desirability pressure?

## Step 4: Propose Improvements (10 min)

For **one** of your selected items, draft:
- **Improved qualitative version** (open-ended, vignette, or projective)
- **Brief rationale** (what does your version capture that the original doesn't?)

## Group Output Template

Prepare **3–5 bullet points** to share with class:

1. **EVS item citation** (short quote or paraphrase + item code if available)
2. **Strengths** (1–2): What does EVS do well here?
3. **Limitations** (1–2): What's constrained or problematic?
4. **Your improved qualitative question**
5. **Sensitivity/ethical considerations** (if relevant)

### Example Output

> **EVS Q6:** "On this list are various groups of people. Could you please mention any that you would not like to have as neighbours?"  
> 
> **Strengths:**  
> - Indirect approach reduces pressure to deny prejudice  
> - List format allows multiple selections  
>
> **Limitations:**  
> - Still fairly direct (asks about personal preferences)  
> - Closed list may miss relevant groups  
> - Doesn't capture reasoning or context  
>
> **Improved qualitative version:**  
> "Think about your neighbourhood. What kinds of qualities or characteristics do you think make for a good neighbour? What kinds of situations might create tension between neighbours?"  
> *(Follow-up probe: "Can you give an example of a situation you've observed or heard about?")*
>
> **Rationale:** Shifts focus to abstract qualities and situations rather than demographic groups, reducing defensiveness while still revealing underlying attitudes. Open-ended format invites storytelling and context.

# 🗣 Part 4: Plenary Discussion (15 min)

## Sharing (10 min)
Each group presents **one key insight** from their EVS audit:
- How does question wording shape the data you get?
- What do you gain (or lose) moving from quantitative to qualitative?

## Synthesis (5 min)
cross-cutting themes:
- Trade-offs between standardization and nuance
- Role of context in qualitative responses
- Ethical considerations in sensitive topic research
- Application to real estate/land economy contexts

---

# ✍️ Part 5: Personal Reflection (10 min)

## Reflection Prompt
> **"What will you do differently when designing your own survey questions for RM01?"**

Write 3–5 sentences addressing:
- One specific wording pitfall you'll avoid
- One context where you'll use qualitative (open-ended) questions
- One sensitive topic you'll approach indirectly (if relevant to your project)

**Save this reflection** with your RM01 project notes.

## Optional: Peer Exchange
If time permits, share your reflection with one other student and discuss:
- Are your projects facing similar design challenges?
- Could you pilot questions on each other before wider distribution?

---

# 📦 Optional Extension / Homework

## Task: Audit Your Own RM01 Survey Draft
Review **three** questions from your own survey design:

1. **Check for pitfalls:**
   - Leading/loaded language? → Neutralize
   - Double-barrelled? → Split into separate items
   - Vague terms? → Define or provide examples

2. **Consider elicitation strategy:**
   - Is any topic sensitive enough to warrant indirect approach?
   - Would a qualitative (open-ended) version add value?
   - Could you mix quantitative and qualitative for richer data?

3. **Revise and document:**
   - Show original version
   - Show revised version
   - Explain your reasoning (1–2 sentences per change)

**Upload** before next session for optional peer review.

# 🧰 Appendix: Quick Reference

## A. Question Wording Checklist

| ❌ Avoid | ✅ Aim For |
|---------|-----------|
| Leading/loaded phrasing | Neutral, balanced language |
| Double-barrelled (two ideas at once) | Single construct per question |
| Vague terms ("often," "regularly") | Specific timeframes, quantities |
| Overly long/complex stems | Concise, clear phrasing |
| Jargon or technical terms | Plain language (or define terms) |
| Assume respondent knowledge | Include context if needed |

## B. Indirect Elicitation Techniques

### For Qualitative Survey Design

| Technique | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Third-person** | Ask about others, not respondent | "How do landlords in your area typically handle tenant disputes?" |
| **Projective** | Respondent interprets someone else's behavior | "Imagine a developer who opposes affordable housing. What might their concerns be?" |
| **Vignette** | Present scenario; ask for reaction/advice | "Sarah is a single mother applying to rent. [Details]. If you were the landlord, what factors would you consider?" |
| **Best-worst scaling** | Force trade-offs between options | "Which of these housing features would you prioritize? Which would you sacrifice?" |
| **Free listing** | Open brainstorming before rating | "List all the factors that influence your property investment decisions." (Then follow with structured questions) |

### For Quantitative Prevalence Estimates (Conceptual—Not Implemented in This Course)

| Technique | Purpose | How It Works |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| **List experiment** | Estimate prevalence of sensitive behavior | Control group sees innocuous list; treatment group sees same list + sensitive item. Difference in means estimates prevalence. |
| **Randomized response** | Protect individual privacy while estimating prevalence | Respondent flips coin privately; answers YES if heads (regardless of truth), answers truthfully if tails. Randomness protects individuals; statistics recover population rate. |

## C. Representativity & Validity

### Key Relationships

```
Representativity → External Validity
    ↓
Can we generalize findings beyond our sample?

Good Question Design → Internal Validity  
    ↓
Are we measuring what we intend to measure?
```

### Survey Weights (Context Only)

- **Design weights:** Correct for unequal selection probabilities
- **Post-stratification weights:** Align sample to population benchmarks
- **Note:** Weighting helps external validity but **cannot fix poor measurement**

### For Your RM01 Projects

Consider:
- **Target population:** Who are you trying to understand?
- **Sampling frame:** Who can you actually reach (Prolific, MTurk, professional networks)?
- **Coverage gaps:** Who's missing? Document these as limitations.
- **Generalizability claims:** Be precise about scope of inference

## D. Connecting to Lab 5 Platform Skills

### Lab 5 Taught You:
- Set up Qualtrics surveys
- Configure consent flows
- Create Prolific/MTurk accounts
- Understand fee structures

### Supervision 7 Builds On This:
- **What questions** to put in your Qualtrics survey
- **How to word** those questions to get valid data
- **When to use** qualitative vs. quantitative approaches
- **How to handle** sensitive topics ethically

### Integration Task (If Time Permits)
Open your Qualtrics account and:
1. Create one **quantitative** question (scale/multiple choice)
2. Create one **qualitative** question (open text with clear prompt)
3. Set up **branch logic** so qualitative question only appears if quantitative response meets certain criteria (e.g., "If dissatisfied, please explain why:")
