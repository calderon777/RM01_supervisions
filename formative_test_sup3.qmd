## In-Class Formative Assessment: Variable Selection (Housing Prices)

### ⏱ Duration
Approx. **40 minutes (in class)**

---

### 🎯 Objective
Apply the **variable selection methods** learned in Supervision 3 to a new dataset on **housing prices**. You will replicate the steps used previously with the *Hitters* dataset, but this time using the *Housing Prices Dataset* from Kaggle.

Your task is to specify, estimate, and evaluate **one or two regression models** explaining house prices.

---

### 📦 Dataset (Preloaded) or [Download the housing dataset](data/house_price.csv)

This dataset has already been provided in your RStudio environment.
```r
install.packages("RKaggle")
library(RKaggle)
# Download and load dataset
house_price_data <- get_dataset("yasserh/housing-prices-dataset")
str(house_price_data)

```
**Dependent variable:** `price`  
**Predictors include:** `area`, `bedrooms`, `bathrooms`, `stories`, `mainroad`, `airconditioning`, `parking`, `furnishingstatus`, etc.

---

### 🧩 Task
You have **40 minutes** to complete the following:

1. **Model setup (5 min)**  
   - Inspect the dataset and identify relevant variables.
   - Choose predictors that you expect to influence `price`.

2. **Model estimation (20 min)**  
   - Estimate one **OLS model** explaining `price`.
   - Perform **stepwise variable selection** (AIC or BIC).  
   - Optionally include **one interaction term** (e.g., `area × stories`).

3. **Diagnostics and reporting (15 min)**  
   - Report the final regression equation.
   - Record **Adjusted R²**, **AIC/BIC**, and **RMSE** (if possible).  
   - Briefly comment on which predictors are most influential and whether signs/magnitudes make sense.

---

### 🧮 Example Structure (you can adapt quickly)
```r
library(MASS)
library(dplyr)

# Example base model
df <- house_price_data
model0 <- lm(price ~ area + bathrooms + stories + airconditioning + parking, data = df)
summary(model0)

# Stepwise selection (AIC)
step_aic <- stepAIC(model0, direction = "both", trace = FALSE)
summary(step_aic)

# Optional: interaction example
model_int <- lm(price ~ area*stories + bathrooms + airconditioning, data = df)
summary(model_int)
```

---

### 🧾 What to Submit (in class)
At the end of the 40 minutes, post your results on Blackboard or Teams (one slide or short markdown cell):
- **Final model equation**  
- **Adjusted R², AIC/BIC**, and any other metric you computed  
- **Interpretation of one key variable or interaction term**  
- **1–2 sentences** on whether the results make economic sense

---

### 💡 Tip
- Use your **Supervision 3 (Hitters)** scripts as a reference.  
- Keep your model **parsimonious but explanatory**.  
- Focus on clarity and reasoning — not the number of variables.
