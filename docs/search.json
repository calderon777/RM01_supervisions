    "text": "Supervisions Overview\nThese supervised laboratory sessions are designed for MPhil students beginning their quantitative research journey. Over several progressive supervision, you will develop from complete programming novice to confident data analysis skills, working with appropriate real-world land economy datasets from institutional sources and applying cutting-edge analytical techniques to substantive research questions in your field.\n\nAcademic Integration\nEach lab connects technical skill development with substantive research applications, ensuring that programming competency serves your broader academic and professional objectives. You’ll work with datasets relevant to housing policy, regional development, and planning analysis while developing reproducible research workflows used in leading academic institutions and policy organisations.\n\n\n\nHow to Use This Interactive Workbook\nThis workbook is designed as a practical, hands-on learning experience that requires active engagement with both the content and your RStudio environment. Success depends on following the structured approach outlined below.\n\n\nEssential Setup\n\nTechnical Requirements\nBefore beginning, ensure you have: - R (version ≥ 4.3) installed from r-project.org - RStudio Desktop (latest version) from posit.co - A stable internet connection for package installation and data downloads - Sufficient disk space (≥ 2GB) for datasets and outputs\n\n\n💾 Install R and RStudio on your laptops/gadgets\nRStudio is a wrapper for R; we are using RStudio because it makes looks R more organised and straightforward. Follow the following instructions:\n\ngo to https://www.r-project.org\nclick on ‘CRAN mirror’\nchoose one of the two UK mirrors - https://www.stats.bris.ac.uk/R/ or https://cran.ma.imperial.ac.uk/\nClick on ‘Download R for Windows’ or ‘Download R for macOS’\nClick on ’install R for the first time\nClick on ‘Download R-… for Windows’, the current version is R-4.5.1. Or alternatively, download the executable file for macOS.\ndouble-click the downloaded file, then click on ‘Run’, ‘language:English’, ‘OK’, and read and follow the instructions of installation until you click on ‘Next’ for installing and ‘Finish’\n\nThen proceed to Installing RStudio.\n\nGo to rstudio.com\nclick on ‘download’\ndownload the Free version, download RStudio for Windows or macOS\nClick on ‘Next’ if you agree and on ‘Install’ and ‘Finish’ to complete the process.\n\n\n\nProject Organisation\nCreate a dedicated folder structure for the course:\nRM01_Labs/\n├── data/           # Raw datasets and imports\n├── scripts/        # Your R code files  \n├── outputs/        # Generated plots, tables, reports\n├── certificates/   # Professional development documentation\n└── reflections/    # Written responses to critical questions\n\n\n\nActive Learning Protocol\n\n1. Read → Code → Reflect\nEach lab section follows this essential pattern: - Read the contextual material and instructions carefully - Code by replicating all examples in your RStudio session - Reflect by answering critical thinking questions in writing\n\n\n2. Hands-On Replication\nCritical: Do not simply read the code examples. You must: - Type (don’t copy-paste) all code into RStudio scripts - Execute each code block and verify the outputs - Experiment with variations and modifications - Debug any errors before proceeding\n\n\n3. Documentation Standards\nMaintain professional documentation practices: - Save each lab as a separate R script (e.g., lab01_certification.R) - Comment your code extensively using # explanatory text - Include session information - Date and version your files systematically\n\n\n\nDeliverables\nEach lab includes specific deliverables: - Technical: Working R scripts with documented code - Visual: Publication-quality plots and analytical outputs\n- Written: Responses to all critical reflection questions - Professional: Certificates, portfolios, and documentation\n\n\nLearning Support\n\nGetting Help\nWhen you encounter difficulties: 1. Review the relevant section carefully for missed details or typos 2. Check R documentation using ?function_name or help(function_name) 3. Examine error messages systematically—they often provide clear guidance and AI can often provide answers 4. Consult peers through appropriate academic channels 5. Attend supervision sessions prepared with specific questions\n\n\nCommon Pitfalls to Avoid\n\nPassive learning: You must complete the materials before attending the face-to-face supervisions.\nPassive reading: You must actively code to learn programming\nCopy-paste coding: Type examples yourself to build muscle memory\nIgnoring errors: Always resolve issues before proceeding\nSuperficial reflections: Engage deeply with methodological questions\nPoor organisation: Maintain systematic file and folder structures\n\n\n\nIndustry Applications\nR programming competency is increasingly valued in: - Policy Analysis: Government departments and think tanks - Consultancy: Urban planning, housing, and development firms - Research Organisations: Academic institutions and policy institutes - Data Science: Emerging opportunities across multiple sectors\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Notes\nLabs will introduce packages progressively. Install required packages as indicated in each session, and maintain a record of your technical environment using:\n# Document your session for reproducibility\nsessionInfo()\n\n\n\nGetting Started\nNavigate to Supervision 1 using the link to begin your journey into R programming for land economy research. Remember: this is an interactive learning experience that requires preparation before attending supervisions, your active participation, critical thinking, and professional engagement.\nSuccess in these labs depends not just on following instructions, but on developing the analytical thinking skills that will serve your research skills.\n\nFor technical support or academic guidance, consult your teaching team or attend designated office hours with specific questions prepared.",

Get oriented in RStudio\nYou need to have installed R and RStudio to continue with this lab.\n\nOpen Rstudio in your computer.\n\n\n\n\nOn this picture, there are three panels ‘the Console’, ‘The Environment’, and ‘The Plots, Help and Files’ panel.\n\n\n\nLet’s choose a better appeareance for our RStudio. Click on Tools&gt;Global Options.\n\n\n\n\nIn RStudio, click on ‘Tools’ and ‘Global Options’\n\n\n\nAfterwards, in the window “Options”, click on “Appearance”, RStudio theme: “Modern”, Editor font: “Courier”, Editor theme: Cobalt. Finally, click on “Apply”\n\n\n\n\nYou are here by clicking on Tools&gt;Global Options..&gt;Appereance&gt;Modern&gt;Courier&gt;Cobalt&gt;Apply\n\n\n\n\n\nB. Your first script\n\nOpen a file to save the code for this session. Click on File → New File → R Script; or simply press Ctrl+Shift+N (command+shift+enter in Mac); this will open a new panel called ‘Script’ where we are going to write the commands for R. Change the name of the script to “lab_1”, saving the script in the folder RM01_Labs/scripts/ File → Save As → “lab_1”\n\n\n\n\nClick on File&gt;New File&gt;R Script\n\n\n\nAdd a comment (starts with #.) On the script panel, type the caracter # and then write 'LAB ONE AND TODAY'S DATE'. R will ignore any line of command starting with #. You can use # to add comments, titles, reminders within your R code/ R Script.\n\nYour R Script now shall look similar to this:\n\n\n\nComments are crucial to learn R\n\n\nThe Rstudio screen has four windows or panels: 1. Console. 2. Environment and history. 3. Files, plots, packages and help. 4. The R script(s) and data view. The R script is where you keep a record of your work or commands - in a line by line basis.\n\nOn your script, type getwd() in line number ‘2’ and hit the keys ‘ctrl+enter’ in your keyboard (The + indicates ‘do it at the same time’), you dont need to press the key ‘+’. After ‘running’ line 2, you will see in the console panel the working directory (or folder) that R is using to download and upload files.\n\n\n\n\nThis image shows how your R Script should look\n\n\n\n\n\nThe outcome in the console -bottom panel after getwd()\n\n\n\n\n\nC. Set your working directory\nChoose your course file folder 📁. Recall we called the working folder folder ‘RM01_labs’. In RStudio’ go to ‘Session’, ‘Set Working Directory’, ‘Choose Directory’, and select this folder.\n\n\n\nCreate your folder and then click on Session&gt;Set Working Directory&gt;Choose Directory\n\n\nThe ‘Console’ panel renders setwd(and a path/directory to your chosen folder in your computer). Copy and paste this output in line 3 from your Console to your R Script. Setting the directory with code and not ‘clicks’ will save you time.\n\n\n\nThis is the code you shall copy and paste in your R Script, ignore ‘&gt;’\n\n\n\n\n\nsetwd() in your R Script\n\n\nSo far, we have created the following script:\n# LAB ONE 25/09/2025\ngetwd()\nsetwd(\"C:/Users/YOUR DIRECTORY/RM01_labs\")\nand this is the Console output:\n&gt; # LAB ONE 25/09/2025\n&gt; getwd()\n[1] \"C:/Users/YOUR DIRECTORY/Documents\"\n&gt; setwd(\"C:/Users/YOUT DIRECTORY/RM01_labs\")\n\n\nD. First calculations & a matrix (3–4 min)\n\nIn your script, run: 5 * 5 (result should be 25 in the Console).\n\n\n&gt; 5*5\n[1] 25\n\n\nCreate a small matrix and run it. Use the following code, explanatory comments are written with #:\n# A is an object, \n# &lt;- is similar to equal\n# 1:8 are the numbers from 1 to 8\n# nrow is the matrix number of rows = 4\n# ncol is the matrix number of columns = 2 \nA &lt;- matrix(1:8, nrow = 4, ncol = 2)\n# The object A now has a matrix. Run the object A\nA\nThe outcome in the console shall be as follows:\n\n\n&gt; # A is an object, \n&gt;    # &lt;- is similar to equal\n&gt;    # 1:8 are the numbers from 1 to 8\n&gt;    # nrow is the matrix number of rows = 4\n&gt;    # ncol is the matrix number of columns = 2 \n&gt;    A &lt;- matrix(1:8, nrow = 4, ncol = 2)\n&gt;    # The object A now has a matrix. Run the object A\n&gt;    A\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    1    5\n[2,]    2    6\n[3,]    3    7\n[4,]    4    8\n\n\nIn brief, you created a matrix called ‘A’, with numbers from 1 to 8, with four rows and two columns.\n\n\n\n\nE. Inspect objects & view data\n\nCheck the Environment tab to see objects you’ve created.\nThe tab History shows a list of commands used do far.\n\n\n\n\nEnvironment Panel\n\n\n\nTo see the matrix A in a new window, type the command View(A) in your script and hit the keys ‘ctrl+enter’ to run that line , this will send you to a different tab. Afterwards, click on your R script to come back.\n\n# LAB ONE 25/09/2025\ngetwd()\nsetwd(\"C:/Users/Cam/OneDrive - University of Cambridge/Cambridge 2025-26/RM01_labs\")\n5*5\n# A is an object, \n# &lt;- is similar to equal\n# 1:8 are the numbers from 1 to 8\n# nrow is the matrix number of rows = 4\n# ncol is the matrix number of columns = 2 \nA &lt;- matrix(1:8, nrow = 4, ncol = 2)\n# The object A now has a matrix. Run the object A\nA\nView(A)\n\n\nF. (Optional) Install and load a package\nThe tab ‘Packages’ shows the list of add-ons included in the installation of RStudio. Click on the tab ‘Packages’, if you check a box next to a package, that package is loaded into R, if not, any command related to that package won’t work, you will need select it. You can also install other add-ons by clicking on the ‘Install’ icon.\nAnother way to install add-ons is to type the function install.packages(\"name of the package\"), and then you will be able to open the library of commands of that package.\n\nIn line 8, to install the package forecast, type install.packages(“forecast”) and hit ctrl+enter. If a window opens, you can hit yes to restart RStudio. See the picture below, make sure you do not get errors in the console. The sign ‘&gt;’ will show when R finishes running a line.\n\n# the function to install packages in R\n# we use \"forecast\" as example\ninstall.packages(\"forecast\") # to install the package\nlibrary(forecast) # to activate the package 'forecast'\nRemember to activate the package by typing ‘library(the package)’, for example, library(forecast) and ctrl+enter. This will activate all functions within the ‘forecast’ package.\nMake sure there are no error messages in the installation, and if so, make sure to solve the issue before continuing.\nThe package forecast is used to analyse and predict time series (e.g. yearly house prices during the last 20 years).\nScript/Data View Window:\n• Begin scripts with a comment for title and description using the hash character (#). Anything after the hash on the same line is considered a comment and is ignored by R. • Code can continue to the next line without a special character, but only if the previous line ends in a way that suggests continuation (e.g., a comma or unclosed brackets). • To run a line of code, position the cursor on the line and press Ctrl+Enter. For multiple lines, select them and press Ctrl+Enter.\nConsole/Output Window:\n• It’s recommended to work in script mode for reusability. • Commands outside the script context can be typed at the bottom of the console, indicated by the “&gt;” sign. • Press Enter to execute a command. • Use the up and down arrows to revisit and edit older lines of code previously typed into the console.\n\n\n\n💾 Save your script\nFile → Save (e.g., lab_1) into your ‘script’ folder. Remember to save your R Scripts after each supervision, this will save you a lot time!\n\n\n✅ Check‑off\n\nI can run code from a script (Ctrl+Enter).\nMy working directory is set via setwd() at the top of the script.\nI created A &lt;- matrix(1:8, 4, 2) and can see it in Environment.\nScript saved.\n\n\n🏁 End of Lab 1 🛑 Remember to save your script 💾",

In applied research, we often need to make predictions. In applied land economics research, prediction is crucial—whether forecasting property values, estimating rental yields, or projecting land use changes. This lab equips you with the tools to make robust predictions and quantify their uncertainty. Let’s begin with the basic prediction workflow.\nOnce we have estimated our regression coefficients \\(b_1\\) (intercept) and \\(b_2\\) (slope), we can use them to predict food expenditure for any given income level using the fitted regression equation (Eq. 2).\n\\[\n\\hat{y} = b_1 + b_2 x \\tag{2}\n\\]\n⚠️Unit conversion: In the following R script “income = $2000” is “income = 20” (the data is in hundreds of dollars).\n\n#### Step 1: Fit the model (recap from Lab 7)\n\nlibrary(PoEdata)\ndata(\"food\")\n\n# Estimate the food expenditure model\nmod1 &lt;- lm(food_exp ~ income, data = food)\n\n# Review estimates\nsummary(mod1)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = food_exp ~ income, data = food)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-223.025  -50.816   -6.324   67.879  212.044 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

Uncertainty!\nThese are point predictions—our single best guess at each income level. But how confident are we?\nConsider the household earning $2,000/week: - We predict they’ll spend $287.60 on food - But there’s sampling uncertainty (our \\(b_1\\) and \\(b_2\\) are estimates) - And individual variation (not all $2,000/week households spend exactly $287.60)\nTwo types of intervals address these concerns:\n\nConfidence intervals answer: “What’s the average food expenditure for all households at this income level?”\nPrediction intervals answer: “What might one specific household at this income level spend?”\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding Prediction Uncertainty Through Sampling Variability\nOur predictions depend entirely on our estimated coefficients (\\(b_1, b_2\\)). But these are sample estimates—if we collected a different dataset, we’d get different values and therefore different predictions.\nBefore making predictions, it’s important to understand that our coefficient estimates vary across samples. This matters for land economics applications: if we’re advising on property valuations, we need to know how sensitive our predictions are to sampling variation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is “sampling with replacement”?\n\n\n\nImagine our 40 observations are numbered balls in an urn. We draw a ball, record its data, put it back, then draw again. Some observations may appear multiple times in a bootstrap sample; others not at all. This mimics the randomness of drawing a new sample from the population.\n\n\nThe following bootstrap exercise (simulating sampling variability) demonstrates this variability by repeatedly resampling our data and re-estimating the model:\n\nN &lt;- nrow(food)   # observations\nC &lt;- 50           # repeats\nS &lt;- 38           # subsample size\n\nsumb2 &lt;- 0        # sum of slopes\nfor (i in 1:C){\n  set.seed(3*i)   # reproducible\n  # Draw a bootstrap sample (with replacement)\n  subsample &lt;- food[sample(1:N, S, replace = TRUE), ]  # bootstrap draw\n  # Fit the model on this bootstrap sample\n  mod2 &lt;- lm(food_exp ~ income, data = subsample)      \n  sumb2 &lt;- sumb2 + coef(mod2)[2]                       # store slope β2\n}\n\nprint(sumb2 / C, digits = 3)   # average slope\n\nincome \n  9.89 \n\n\nCompare this bootsrap average (repeated samples) witht the original OLS regression output (from mod1) for \\(b_2\\). They should be similar, confirming that OLS is unbiased.\n\n\nEstimated Variances and Covariance of Coefficients\nThe variance-covariance matrix tells us two crucial things: 1. Variances (diagonal): How much each coefficient estimate varies 2. Covariances (off-diagonal): How the estimates move together\nThis matters for prediction because uncertainty in \\(\\hat{y}\\) depends on uncertainty in both coefficients and their correlation.

In Lab 8, we made predictions. But how do we know if our findings are statistically meaningful? Consider our food expenditure model:\nWe estimated that food spending increases by $10.21 for every $100 increase in income But is this effect real, or could it be due to random chance? Could the true effect actually be zero (no relationship)?\nHypothesis testing provides a formal framework to answer these questions.\n💡 Land Economics Application When valuing agricultural land, we might find that proximity to roads increases land value by £500 per meter. But before advising clients, we need to know: Is this effect statistically significant, or could it be sampling noise?\n\nPART A - Hypothesis Tests for Individual Coefficients\nWe start with two competing claims: \\[\nH_0: \\beta_k = c, \\qquad H_A: \\beta_k \\ne c.\n\\]\nTest statistic:\nUnder the null hypothesis, the test statistic follows a t-distribution: \\[\nt = \\frac{b_k - c}{\\operatorname{se}(b_k)},\\quad t \\sim t_{N-2}.\\tag{6}\n\\]\nwhere:\n\\(b_k\\)​ is our estimated coefficient\n\\(c\\) is the hypothesized value (zero in our case)\n\\(\\operatorname{se}(b_k)\\) is the standard error of \\(b_k\\)\n\\(N−K\\) is degrees of freedom (N observations, K parameters)\nIntuition: This ratio measures how many standard errors our estimate is away from the hypothesized value.\nExample 1: Two-Tailed Test (Is there any effect?)

Remember: the alternative hypothesis represents what you’re trying to find evidence for.\n\n\n\nPART B - The p‑Value Approach\nThe p-value represents the probability of observing a t-statistic as extreme as, or more extreme than, the one obtained from the sample, assuming the null hypothesis is true. In other words, it measures how compatible the data are with the null hypothesis. We reject the null hypothesis when the p-value is smaller than the chosen significance level (e.g., 0.05).\nFor a right-tailed test, the p-value corresponds to the area to the right of the calculated t-statistic. For a left-tailed test, it is the area to the left of the calculated t-statistic. For a two-tailed test, the total p-value is divided equally between both tails—p/2 in the left tail and p/2 in the right tail.\nIn R, p-values are obtained using the function pt(t, df), where t is the calculated t-ratio and df is the model’s degrees of freedom. For two-tailed tests, the result should be adjusted to account for both tails, typically using 2*(1 - pt(abs(t), df)).\nDecision rule: Reject \\(H_0\\)​ if \\(p-value&lt;αp\\) Fail to reject \\(H_0\\)​ if \\(p-value≥αp\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon Significance Levels\n\n\n\n\nα = 0.05 (most common): We’re willing to accept a 5% chance of incorrectly rejecting H₀\nα = 0.01 (more conservative): Only 1% chance of Type I error\nα = 0.10 (more lenient): Accept 10% chance of error\n\nThe smaller the p-value, the stronger the evidence against H₀\n\n\nComputing p-Values: \\(F_t\\) stands for the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the t-distribution.\nRight‑tail: \\(p = 1 - F_t(t)\\) (probability in the upper tail)\nLeft‑tail: \\(p = F_t(t)\\) (probability in the lower tail)\nTwo‑tail: \\(p = 2 * (1-F_t(|t|)\\) (probability in both tails)\nExample 1: Right-Tail Test Question: Is the marginal effect of income on food expenditure greater than $5.50?\n\\[H_0: \\beta_2 \\leq 5.5 \\quad \\text{vs} \\quad H_A: \\beta_2 &gt;

You will practise the implementation in R, interpret outputs carefully, and connect diagnostics back to modeling decisions.\n\nThe Gauss–Markov theorem assumes homoskedasticity (constant error variance \\(\\sigma^2\\)). In many economic datasets, variance grows with some regressors (e.g., higher‑income households show more dispersion in expenditure). With heteroskedasticity, OLS coefficients remain unbiased, but standard errors and therefore, with heteroskedasticity, OLS coefficients remain unbiased (under exogeneity) but the usual SEs are inconsistent—use HC (White) or other robust SEs. For completeness, apart from homoskedasticity, Gauss–Markov (for OLS to be BLUE) also requires linearity in parameters, no perfect collinearity, and exogeneity. Independence/no autocorrelation is also standard in time-series contexts.\n\n\n🧰 Packages\nlmtest, broom, PoEdata, car, sandwich, knitr\n\n# install.packages(c(\"lmtest\",\"broom\",\"PoEdata\",\"car\",\"sandwich\",\"knitr\"))  # install once if needed\n\nlibrary(lmtest)    # tests for regression models (e.g., Breusch-Pagan)\n\nLoading required package: zoo\n\n\nWarning: package 'zoo' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'zoo'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    as.Date, as.Date.numeric\n\nlibrary(broom)     # tidy/glance/augment model outputs\nlibrary(PoEdata)   # course datasets\nlibrary(car)       # diagnostics (e.g., VIF)\nlibrary(sandwich)  # robust (heteroskedasticity-consistent) SEs\nlibrary(knitr)     # neat tables (kable)\n\ndata(\"food\", package = \"PoEdata\")            # load the 'food' dataset\nmod1 &lt;- lm(food_exp ~ income, data = food)   # simple OLS: food expenditure explained by income\n\n# Scatter and fitted line\nplot(food$income, food$food_exp,             # scatterplot of income vs. food expenditure\n     xlab = \"income\", ylab = \"food expenditure\",\n     pch = 19, col = \"grey\")                 # filled points, grey color\nabline(mod1, lwd = 2)                        # add fitted regression line with thicker stroke\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpotting heteroskedasticity with residual plots\nResidual plots help detect heteroskedasticity visually.

    "text": "Lab 16 — Serial Correlation (Autocorrelation)\n\n🎯 Learning outcomes\n\nUnderstand the core ideas and assumptions for this lab’s topic.\nImplement the workflow in R and create tidy outputs with clear captions.\nInterpret results in context and connect diagnostics to modeling decisions.\nRecognise common pitfalls and perform basic robustness checks.\n\n\n\n\n🧰 Prerequisites\n\nMultiple regression and inference (t-tests, F-tests).\nR and RStudio installed.\nPackages: broom, knitr, and any other packages used in the lab code.\n\n\n\n\nOverview\nSerial correlation occurs when regression errors are correlated across time periods. In a time series regression, if \\(e_t\\) is correlated with \\(e_{t-1}\\)​, \\(e_{t-2}\\)​, etc., we have serial correlation.\nSerial correlation is correlation across time in a series. In regression, autocorrelated errors lead to incorrect standard errors (and misleading t-tests). We may incorrectly conclude that coefficients are statistically significant.\nCommon causes:\n\nOmitted variables that vary systematically over time\nModel misspecification (wrong functional form)\nInertia or persistence in economic variables (e.g., GDP growth tends to persist)\n\nThe fix: Use HAC (heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent) standard errors, or model the autocorrelation structure explicitly (e.g., AR models, dynamic specifications).\nTo diagnose whether growth is autocorrelated, we create scatter plots comparing growth at time t with growth at time \\(t+1\\) (lag 1) and \\(t+2\\) (lag 2).\nWhat to look for:\nPositive correlation (upward diagonal pattern) → high growth tends to follow high growth Negative correlation (downward diagonal pattern) → high growth followed by low growth Random scatter → no autocorrelation\nThe reference lines divide the plot at the means, creating four quadrants. With positive autocorrelation, most points fall in the upper-right and lower-left quadrants.\n\n\nExample: growth vs unemployment (Okun’s data)\nThe okun dataset contains quarterly US data on:\ng: Real GDP growth rate (percentage change) u: Unemployment rate\nOkun’s Law describes the inverse relationship between GDP growth and changes in unemployment. Before running regressions with time series data, we should check whether the series themselves exhibit autocorrelation.\n\ndata(\"okun\", package = \"PoEdata\")     # load Okun's law quarterly dataset\nokun.ts &lt;- ts(okun, start = c(1948, 1), frequency = 4)  # declare the data 'quarterly' time-series object\n\n# Plot time series GDP%\nplot(okun.ts[, \"g\"], ylab = \"growth\")         # real GDP growth over time\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot(okun.ts[, \"u\"], ylab = \"unemployment\")   # unemployment rate over time\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Scatter with lags/leads\nggL1 &lt;- data.frame(\n  g   = okun.ts[, \"g\"],\n  gL1 = stats::lag(okun.ts[, \"g\"], -1)        # lead by 1 quarter (stats::lag with -1 shifts forward)\n)\nplot(ggL1)                                    # scatter of g vs. g(+1)\nabline(h = mean(ggL1$gL1, na.rm = TRUE),      # horizontal line at mean of g(+1)\n       v = mean(ggL1$g,   na.rm = TRUE), lty = 2)       # vertical line at mean of g\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggL2 &lt;- data.frame(\n  g   = okun.ts[, \"g\"],\n  gL2 = stats::lag(okun.ts[, \"g\"], -2)        # lead by 2 quarters\n)\nplot(ggL2)                                    # scatter of g vs. g(+2)\nabline(h = mean(ggL2$gL2, na.rm = TRUE),\n       v = mean(ggL2$g,   na.rm = TRUE), lty = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpreting lag scatter plots\n\n\n\nIn the lag-1 plot (\\(g\\) vs \\(g_{t+1}\\)): - If points cluster along an upward-sloping diagonal, growth exhibits positive autocorrelation - Most points in upper-right and lower-left quadrants → when growth is high today, it tends to be high next quarter - This pattern suggests persistence or momentum in GDP growth\nIn the lag-2 plot (\\(g\\) vs \\(g_{t+2}\\)): - A weaker diagonal pattern suggests autocorrelation diminishes at longer lags - If points become more randomly scattered, correlation decays over time\nWhy this matters for regression: If the residuals from your regression show similar patterns, standard errors will be incorrect.\n\n\nThe Autocorrelation Function (ACF)\nThe ACF provides a formal measure of correlation at different lags:\n\\(\\rho_k = \\text{Corr}(g_t, g_{t-k}) = \\dfrac{\\text{Cov}(g_t, g_{t-k})}{\\text{Var}(g_t)}\\) \nwhere \\(k\\) is the lag (1, 2, 3, …).\n\nHow to read the correlogram:\n\nEach vertical bar shows \\(\\hat{\\rho}_k\\) (the estimated correlation at lag k).\nBlue dashed lines: 95% confidence bounds (approximately \\(\\pm \\dfrac{2}{\\sqrt{n}}\\)).\nBars outside the bounds → statistically significant autocorrelation.\nBars inside the bounds → not significantly different from zero.\n\nBars outside the bounds → statistically significant autocorrelation Bars inside the bounds → not significantly different from zero\n\n# Correlogram (autocorrelation function) for growth\nacf(okun.ts[, \"g\"])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhillips curve example and BG/DW tests\n\nlibrary(dynlm)                                 # dynamic linear models for time series\n\nWarning: package 'dynlm' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\ndata(\"phillips_aus\", package = \"PoEdata\")      # Australian Phillips-curve data\nphill.ts &lt;- ts(phillips_aus, start = c(1987, 1), end = c(2009, 3), frequency = 4)  # quarterly ts\ninflation &lt;- phill.ts[, \"inf\"]                 # inflation series\nDu &lt;- diff(phill.ts[, \"u\"])                    # change in unemployment (∆u_t)\n\n# FDL model: inf_t = β1 + β2 * ∆u_t + e_t\nphill.dyn &lt;- dynlm(inf ~ diff(u), data = phill.ts)                 # regress inflation on ∆unemployment\nkable(tidy(phill.dyn), caption = \"Summary of the `phillips` model\")# tidy+format regression output\n\nWarning: The `tidy()` method for objects of class `dynlm` is not maintained by the broom team, and is only supported through the `lm` tidier method.

They almost overlap, which is why results are so similar and logit ≈ 1.6 × probit in scale. Let’s compare the CDFs:\n\n# Logistic vs Probit (variance-matched) — super short CDF plot\nsd_match &lt;- pi / sqrt(3)              # match Normal variance to Logistic\ncurve(plogis(x), from=-6, to=6, lwd=2, xlab=\"Latent index (x)\", ylab=\"CDF\",\n      main=\"CDF: Logistic vs Normal (variance-matched)\")\ncurve(pnorm(x, sd=sd_match), from=-6, to=6, lwd=2, lty=2, add=TRUE)\nlegend(\"topleft\", c(\"Logistic (logit)\", \"Normal scaled (probit)\"),\n       lwd=2, lty=c(1,2), bty=\"n\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the next chunk we suppress printing baseline models to avoid overwhelming output (too many variables). However, we run backward stepwise (BIC) and present a compact, readable table of that selected model.

The AUC (Area Under the Curve) is a single summary metric that measures how well a model can distinguish between classes, with a higher value indicating better performance. A perfect classifier has an AUC of (1.0), while a random classifier has an AUC of (0.5). \nWe evaluate ranking performance via ROC curves and AUC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nROC intuition\n\n\n\nROC doesn’t evaluate the predicted probability, but the ranking quality.\n\n“Among all pairs of houses, how often does the model rank the expensive one higher?”\n\n\nAUC = 0.5 → random odds\nAUC = 1.0 → perfect ranking\n\n\n\nA ROC curve evaluates how well the model ranks positives above negatives across all possible thresholds. It does not measure overall “percent correct,” but the trade-off between true positive rate (sensitivity) and false positive rate as the cutoff moves. The AUC summarizes ranking ability from 0.5 (random) to 1.0 (perfect). Two models can have similar accuracy at one cutoff yet different AUCs, which is why ROC/AUC is informative.\n\n# ROC objects (treating 1 as the positive class)\nroc_logit  &lt;- roc(df$high_price, df$p_logit)\nroc_probit &lt;- roc(df$high_price, df$p_probit)\n\n# AUC values\nauc(roc_logit)\n\nArea under the curve: 0.9746\n\nauc(roc_probit)\n\nArea under the curve: 0.9745\n\n# Simple ROC plots with ggplot2\nautoplot_roc &lt;- function(roc_obj, title){\n  # Build a data frame with TPR (sensitivity) and FPR (1 - specificity)\n  plot_df &lt;- data.frame(\n    tpr = roc_obj$sensitivities,\n    fpr = 1 - roc_obj$specificities\n  )\n  ggplot(plot_df, aes(x = fpr, y = tpr)) +\n    geom_line() +\n    geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, linetype = 2) +\n    labs(x = \"False Positive Rate\", y = \"True Positive Rate\", title = title)\n}\n\nautoplot_roc(roc_logit,  paste0(\"ROC – Logit (AUC = \", round(auc(roc_logit), 3), \")\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nautoplot_roc(roc_probit, paste0(\"ROC – Probit (AUC = \", round(auc(roc_probit), 3), \")\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n✂️ Choosing a Threshold & Confusion Matrices\nClassification requires a threshold on predicted probabilities. The Youden J criterion often gives a better cut-off than the naïve 0.5.\nChoosing a single cutoff is a separate decision from estimating probabilities. The default 0.5 is arbitrary and may be sub-optimal when the costs of false positives and false negatives differ. The Youden J statistic selects the threshold that maximizes sensitivity + specificity − 1, giving a balanced operating point. We will compare results at 0.5 and at the Youden-optimal threshold\n\n# Optimal thresholds by Youden's J\nthr_logit  &lt;- coords(roc_logit,  x = \"best\", best.method = \"youden\", transpose = TRUE)[\"threshold\"]\nthr_probit &lt;- coords(roc_probit, x = \"best\", best.method = \"youden\", transpose = TRUE)[\"threshold\"]\n\nthr_logit; thr_probit\n\nthreshold \n0.4980051 \n\n\nthreshold \n0.4479988 \n\n\nA confusion matrix maps predictions to actuals and classifies outcomes into four cells: True Positive (correct 1), False Positive (false alarm), False Negative (missed 1), and True Negative (correct 0). Sensitivity = TP/(TP+FN) is a rate “how many actual true positives we catch from all true positives?”\nSpecificity = TN/(TN+FP) asks “how many actual 0s did we avoid flagging?”\n\n# Helper to compute a confusion matrix and basic metrics without extra packages\nconfusion_metrics &lt;- function(y_true, y_prob, thr = 0.5) {\n  y_pred &lt;- ifelse(y_prob &gt;= thr, 1L, 0L)\n  TP &lt;- sum(y_pred == 1 & y_true == 1, na.rm = TRUE)\n  TN &lt;- sum(y_pred == 0 & y_true == 0, na.rm = TRUE)\n  FP &lt;- sum(y_pred == 1 & y_true == 0, na.rm = TRUE)\n  FN &lt;- sum(y_pred == 0 & y_true == 1, na.rm = TRUE)\n  acc &lt;- (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)\n  tpr &lt;- TP / (TP + FN)  # sensitivity / recall\n  tnr &lt;- TN / (TN + FP)  # specificity\n  ppv &lt;- TP / (TP + FP)  # precision\n  npv &lt;- TN / (TN + FN)  # negative predicted value\n  list(\n    threshold = thr,\n    matrix = matrix(c(TN, FP, FN, TP), nrow = 2,\n                    dimnames = list(\"Predicted\" = c(\"0\",\"1\"), \"Actual\" = c(\"0\",\"1\"))),\n    accuracy = acc, sensitivity = tpr, specificity = tnr, precision = ppv, npv = npv\n  )\n}\n\n# Confusion matrices at 0.5 and at the optimal Youden threshold\ncm_logit_05 &lt;- confusion_metrics(df$high_price, df$p_logit,  thr = 0.5)\ncm_probit_05 &lt;- confusion_metrics(df$high_price, df$p_probit, thr = 0.5)\ncm_logit_opt &lt;- confusion_metrics(df$high_price, df$p_logit,  thr = as.numeric(thr_logit))\ncm_probit_opt &lt;- confusion_metrics(df$high_price, df$p_probit, thr = as.numeric(thr_probit))\n\ncm_logit_05\n\n$threshold\n[1] 0.5\n\n$matrix\n         Actual\nPredicted    0    1\n        0 1333  134\n        1  109 1342\n\n$accuracy\n[1] 0.9167238\n\n$sensitivity\n[1] 0.9092141\n\n$specificity\n[1] 0.9244105\n\n$precision\n[1] 0.9248794\n\n$npv\n[1] 0.9086571\n\ncm_probit_05\n\n$threshold\n[1] 0.5\n\n$matrix\n         Actual\nPredicted    0    1\n        0 1330  140\n        1  112 1336\n\n$accuracy\n[1] 0.9136395\n\n$sensitivity\n[1] 0.9051491\n\n$specificity\n[1] 0.9223301\n\n$precision\n[1] 0.9226519\n\n$npv\n[1] 0.9047619\n\ncm_logit_opt\n\n$threshold\n[1] 0.4980051\n\n$matrix\n         Actual\nPredicted    0    1\n        0 1333  132\n        1  109 1344\n\n$accuracy\n[1] 0.9174092\n\n$sensitivity\n[1] 0.9105691\n\n$specificity\n[1] 0.9244105\n\n$precision\n[1] 0.9249828\n\n$npv\n[1] 0.9098976\n\ncm_probit_opt\n\n$threshold\n[1] 0.4479988\n\n$matrix\n         Actual\nPredicted    0    1\n        0 1310  109\n        1  132 1367\n\n$accuracy\n[1] 0.9174092\n\n$sensitivity\n[1] 0.9261518\n\n$specificity\n[1] 0.9084605\n\n$precision\n[1] 0.9119413\n\n$npv\n[1] 0.9231853\n\n\n\n\nFinal takeaway\n\nLogit and probit tell the same economic story\nAMEs let us interpret effects in percentage points\nROC/Youden threshold evaluates predictive/classification performance\n\n\n\n\n📝 What to Report (suggested structure)\n\nModel setup: how the binary target was defined; why the median.\nEstimation: logit & probit results; include robust SE tables.\nInterpretation: AMEs for key variables (e.g., ln_area, overall_qual, baths_total).\nPerformance: AUC for both models; comment on similarity/differences.\nClassification: confusion matrices at 0.5 and at the Youden-optimal threshold; discuss trade-offs.\nReflection: when would you prefer logit vs probit?

Reweight to match UK census margins\nLimitation: Weighting reduces certain biases but cannot fix poor question design\n\n\n\nKey Takeaway\nRepresentative sampling + good weights help external validity.\nGood question design helps internal validity (measuring what you intend to measure).\nYou need both.",

Holding other factors constant, the estimated coefficient on area is approximately 252.1. This implies that each additional unit of floor area increases the predicted price by about that amount, reflecting the strong and intuitive role of size in property valuation. The magnitude is economically plausible and aligns with the positive effects seen for amenities (e.g., airconditioning, prefarea).\n\n\n\n4) Economic sense?\nYes. Larger homes (area), additional bathrooms and stories, better amenities (air conditioning, hot-water heating), and desirable location (prefarea, access to mainroad) all increase predicted prices, while being unfurnished reduces price—precisely what standard housing market theory would anticipate. The model therefore captures realistic drivers of housing values while balancing fit and simplicity via BIC.",

    "text": "Short interpretation notes (for students)\n\nCollinearity: Replacing labor with labor_density reduced VIFs (improves stability of estimates).\nAutocorrelation: Final log–log model (best) passes DW/BG (no serial correlation).\nHeteroskedasticity: BP/White indicate non-constant variance → report robust SEs.\nElasticities: In the log–log model, coefficients read as % changes (e.g., 0.82 on log(area) ≈ 1% ↑ area → 0.82% ↑ output, ceteris paribus).\n\nFinal report: The preferred specification is a log–log production function with a dynamic term: \\(log(\\text{prod}_t) = \\alpha + \\beta1 \\log(\\text{prod}{t-1}) + \\beta_2 \\log(\\text{area}_t) + \\beta_3 \\log(\\text{fert}_t) +\\) \\(\\beta_4 \\log(\\text{labor/area}t) + u_t\\)\nDiagnostics follow textbook order. Multicollinearity: baseline VIFs were moderate (area ≈ 7.27, labor ≈ 7.06), so I replaced labor with labor density, reducing VIFs to ≤~3.74. Autocorrelation: the revised level model exhibited positive AR(1) serial correlation (DW ≈ 1.74; BG p ≈ 0.013; ACF consistent with AR(1) and possible AR(2)), which motivated adding a lagged dependent variable and moving to a log–log form. In the final model, DW ≈ 2.02 and BG(1) p ≈ 0.83 indicate no remaining autocorrelation. Heteroskedasticity: both BP and White-type tests reject homoskedasticity, so I report HC1 and HAC (Newey–West) standard errors; inference is unchanged. Interpretation: Coefficients are elasticities. Output elasticity w.r.t. cultivated area is ≈0.82, fertiliser ≈0.20, and labor density ≈0.44: a 1% rise in each raises output by roughly 0.82%, 0.20%, and 0.44%, respectively. The small negative coefficient on (\\(\\log(\\text{prod}{t-1}\\))) suggests modest mean reversion after shocks. Overall, the transformed specification is well‑behaved and economically interpretable, with robust inference to heteroskedasticity and HAC corrections.",
