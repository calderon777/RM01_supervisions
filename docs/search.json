    "text": "How to Use This Interactive Workbook\nThis workbook is designed as a practical, hands-on learning experience that requires active engagement with both the content and your RStudio environment. Success depends on following the structured approach outlined below.\n\nEssential Setup\n\nTechnical Requirements\nBefore beginning, ensure you have: - R (version ≥ 4.3) installed from r-project.org - RStudio Desktop (latest version) from posit.co - A stable internet connection for package installation and data downloads - Sufficient disk space (≥ 2GB) for datasets and outputs\n\n\n💾 Install R and RStudio on your laptops/gadgets\nRStudio is a wrapper for R; we are using RStudio because it makes looks R more organised and straightforward. Follow the following instructions:\n\ngo to https://www.r-project.org\nclick on ‘CRAN mirror’\nchoose one of the two UK mirrors - https://www.stats.bris.ac.uk/R/ or https://cran.ma.imperial.ac.uk/\nClick on ‘Download R for Windows’ or ‘Download R for macOS’\nClick on ’install R for the first time\nClick on ‘Download R-… for Windows’, the current version is R-4.5.1. Or alternatively, download the executable file for macOS.\ndouble-click the downloaded file, then click on ‘Run’, ‘language:English’, ‘OK’, and read and follow the instructions of installation until you click on ‘Next’ for installing and ‘Finish’\n\nThen proceed to Installing RStudio.\n\nGo to rstudio.com\nclick on ‘download’\ndownload the Free version, download RStudio for Windows or macOS\nClick on ‘Next’ if you agree and on ‘Install’ and ‘Finish’ to complete the process.\n\n\n\nProject Organisation\nCreate a dedicated folder structure for the course:\nRM01_Labs/\n├── data/           # Raw datasets and imports\n├── scripts/        # Your R code files  \n├── outputs/        # Generated plots, tables, reports\n├── certificates/   # Professional development documentation\n└── reflections/    # Written responses to critical questions\n\n\n\nActive Learning Protocol\n\n1. Read → Code → Reflect\nEach lab section follows this essential pattern: - Read the contextual material and instructions carefully - Code by replicating all examples in your RStudio session - Reflect by answering critical thinking questions in writing\n\n\n2. Hands-On Replication\nCritical: Do not simply read the code examples. You must: - Type (don’t copy-paste) all code into RStudio scripts - Execute each code block and verify the outputs - Experiment with variations and modifications - Debug any errors before proceeding\n\n\n3. Documentation Standards\nMaintain professional documentation practices: - Save each lab as a separate R script (e.g., lab01_certification.R) - Comment your code extensively using # explanatory text - Include session information - Date and version your files systematically\n\n\n\nDeliverables\nEach lab includes specific deliverables: - Technical: Working R scripts with documented code - Visual: Publication-quality plots and analytical outputs\n- Written: Responses to all critical reflection questions - Professional: Certificates, portfolios, and documentation\n\n\nLearning Support\n\nGetting Help\nWhen you encounter difficulties: 1. Review the relevant section carefully for missed details or typos 2. Check R documentation using ?function_name or help(function_name) 3. Examine error messages systematically—they often provide clear guidance and AI can often provide answers 4. Consult peers through appropriate academic channels 5. Attend supervision sessions prepared with specific questions\n\n\nCommon Pitfalls to Avoid\n\nPassive learning: You must complete the materials before attending the face-to-face supervisions.\nPassive reading: You must actively code to learn programming\nCopy-paste coding: Type examples yourself to build muscle memory\nIgnoring errors: Always resolve issues before proceeding\nSuperficial reflections: Engage deeply with methodological questions\nPoor organisation: Maintain systematic file and folder structures\n\n\n\nIndustry Applications\nR programming competency is increasingly valued in: - Policy Analysis: Government departments and think tanks - Consultancy: Urban planning, housing, and development firms - Research Organisations: Academic institutions and policy institutes - Data Science: Emerging opportunities across multiple sectors",

    "text": "📘 Introduction to R\nAfter downloading and installing open RStudio, we will cover now some tutorials.\n👨‍💻 Long Tutorial\nWe would cover a brief introduction on this labs, students would like to cover a longer tutorial to get use to R quickly. Click on this link: https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.pdf\n👨‍💻 Quick tutorial - RStudio Screen\nYou need to have installed R and RStudio to continue with this lab.\n\nOpen Rstudio in your computer.\n\n\n\n\nOn this picture, there are three panels ‘the Console’, ‘The Environment’, and ‘The Plots, Help and Files’ panel.\n\n\n\nLet’s choose a better appeareance for our RStudio. Click on “Tools” and then “Global Options.”\n\n\n\n\nIn RStudio, click on ‘Tools’ and ‘Global Options’\n\n\n\nAfterwards, in the window “Options”, click on “Appearance”, RStudio theme: “Modern”, Editor font: “Courier”, Editor theme: Cobalt. Finally, click on “Apply”\n\n\n\n\nYou are here by clicking on Tools&gt;Global Options..&gt;Appereance&gt;Modern&gt;Courier&gt;Cobalt&gt;Apply\n\n\n\nNow, we want to open a file to save the code that we are learning during this session. Click on ‘File’, ‘New File’, and ‘R Script’; or simply press Ctrl+Shift+N; this will open a new panel called ‘Script’ where we are going to write the commands for R. The name of the script is Untitled 1. At the end of this session save the script in a folder for this module.\n\n\n\n\nClick on File&gt;New File&gt;R Script\n\n\nLet’s learn how to write our own comments in our R code/ script.\n\nOn the script panel, type the caracter # and then write 'LAB ONE AND TODAY'S DATE'.\n\nR will ignore any line of command starting with #. You can use # to add comments, titles, reminders within your R code/ R Script. If you did it right, your R Script shall look like this:\n\n\n\nComments are crucial to learn R\n\n\nThe Rstudio screen has four windows or panels: 1. Console. 2. Environment and history. 3. Files, plots, packages and help. 4. The R script(s) and data view. The R script is where you keep a record of your work or commands - in a line by line basis. For Stata users this would be like the do-file, for SPSS users is like the syntax and for SAS users the SAS program.\n\nLet’s type getwd() in line number ‘2’ and hit the keys ‘ctrl+enter’ in your keyboard at the same time - The + indicates ‘do it at the same time’, you dont need to press the key ‘+’ . If you did this correctly you will see in the console panel the folder or working directory that R is using to download and upload data.\n\n\n\n\nThis image shows how your R Script should look and the outcome in the console -bottom panel after using ctrl+enter\n\n\nLet’s create a folder in Windows for your course using 📁 File Explorer. I called my folder ‘R code – LABs’. Afterwards, in RStudio’ go to ‘Session’, ‘Set Working Directory’, ‘Choose Directory’, and select the folder ‘R code – LABs’ or the name you used.\n\n\n\nCreate your folder and then click on Session&gt;Set Working Directory&gt;Choose Directory\n\n\nThe above will render a result within the ‘Console’ panel, this is the code setwd(and a path/directory to your chosen folder in your computer). Copy and paste that in your R code; next time you will only need to hit ‘ctrl+enter’ on ‘setwd(your directory)’ to set the directory or folder where you are going to work in R.\n\n\n\nThis is the code you shall copy and paste in your R Script, ignore ‘&gt;’\n\n\n\nCopy and paste the outcome of you console in your R code; next time you will only need to hit ‘ctrl’ and ‘enter’ to set working directory.\n\n\n\n\nsetwd() example in your R Script\n\n\n\nIn line number 4, type 5*5 and hit ‘ctrl’ and ‘enter’, the console will show the code and the result, 25.\nLet’s also create a matrix. Use the in the picture below -lines 5 and 6, put them on your script and hit ctrl+enter to line 5 and then 6.\n\n\n\n\nA multiplication and your first matrix\n\n\nIf you did it correctly, the outcome in the console will be as follows:\n\n\n\nMultiplication and matrix output in your Console\n\n\n\nIn the line 5, you asked R to create a matrix called ‘A’, with numbers from 1 to 8, with four rows and two columns.\n\nHave a look at the ‘Environment’ panel, you can see in there all active objects(e.g. matrix A), and the panel ‘History’ shows a list of commands used do far.\n\n\n\nEnvironment Panel\n\n\n\nTo see the matrix A in a new window, type the command View(A) in line 7 and hit the keys ‘ctrl+enter’ to run line 7, this will send you to a different tab. Afterwards, come back to your R script by clicking on ‘Untitled 1’.\n\n\n\n\nSample of function View()\n\n\nPackages tab\nThe package tab shows the list of add-ons included in the installation of RStudio. If checked, the package is loaded into R, if not, any command related to that package won’t work, you will need select it. You can also install other add-ons by clicking on the ‘Install Packages’ icon.\nAnother way to install add-ons is to type the function install.packages(\"name of the package\"), and then you will be able to open the library of commands of that package.\n\nIn line 8, to install the package forecast, type install.packages(“forecast”) and hit ctrl+enter. In the next window, you can hit yes to restart RStudio. See the picture below, you shall not get errors in the console, and at the end, the sign ‘&gt;’ will let you know the instalation run OK.\n\n\n\n\nFunction install.packages() and installing package ‘forecast’\n\n\nYou must activate the package by typing ‘library(the package)’, for example, library(forecast) and ctrl+enter. In this case, this will automatically open all functions within the ‘forecast’ package.\n\n\n\nlibrary() function and sample with package ‘forecast’\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Console will show this result after ‘running’ library(“forecast”)\n\n\nWe will use the package forecast in this course to analyse and predict economic time series.\nScript/Data View Window:\n• Begin scripts with a comment for title and description using the hash character (#). Anything after the hash on the same line is considered a comment and is ignored by R. • Code can continue to the next line without a special character, but only if the previous line ends in a way that suggests continuation (e.g., a comma or unclosed brackets). • To run a line of code, position the cursor on the line and press Ctrl+Enter. For multiple lines, select them and press Ctrl+Enter.\nConsole/Output Window:\n• It’s recommended to work in script mode for reusability. • Commands outside the script context can be typed at the bottom of the console, indicated by the “&gt;” sign. • Press Enter to execute a command. • Use the up and down arrows to revisit and edit older lines of code previously typed into the console.\nDo not forget to 💾 save your R script in your own course folder! Use the icon to save, I called my file “lab001” and now is available , folder ‘R code – LABs’\n\n\n\nRemember to save your R Scripts, this will save you a lot time!",

Adjust sheet/skip and pick exact names after inspecting names().\nPart C — Pasting the generated code ensures others (and future you) can reproduce the import without the UI.\nPart D — Rent inflation tends to cluster in waves; periods of rapid increases are visible as peaks, slowdowns as troughs. Index-by-month labelling clarifies timing.\nPart E — Add a zero line; annotate notable policy changes or shocks; consider shading for periods of sustained acceleration.\nPart F — CSV imports avoid Excel formatting quirks but require careful type checks. Both routes can be reproducible if code-driven.\nPart G — Regions often co-move with the UK but can diverge due to local supply constraints, policy differences, or demand shocks.\nPart H — Useful plot() args: las (label orientation), xaxt/yaxt (axis toggles), lwd (line width), xlab/ylab (clear labels), xlim/ylim (focus range).\nPart I — Any sensible numeric pair (e.g., household income vs spending) supports regression line illustrations with abline(lm(y ~ x, data = andy)).\n\nEnd of Lab 3",

All variables are numeric.\nPart C: States differ widely in population and area; later rows (western states) often have larger land areas.\nPart D: Population and Area show the widest spread.\nPart F: Populations vary dramatically; California, New York, Texas are clear outliers.\nPart G: Clear negative relationship: higher income states tend to have lower illiteracy.\nPart H: Income vs Illiteracy, Life Expectancy vs Murder, and Population vs Area show strong patterns.\nPart I: Type “b” (points and lines) is clearer for showing gradual variation than type “h” (histogram-like lines).\nPart J: Useful arguments include pch (point type) and col (colour).\nPart K: Labels help; better axis labels might specify units (e.g., dollars, years).\nPart L: Southern states often stand out with higher murder rates.\nPart M: Highlights disparities in illiteracy across regions; relevant to education policy.\nPart N: Income is slightly right-skewed; most states cluster around the middle with a few richer outliers.\nPart O: Median life expectancy around 70 years; some outliers with lower values.\nPart P: Population and Area show the most variability; Life Expectancy the least.\nPart Q: Scatterplot of Income vs Illiteracy and histogram of Murder are most useful for policy; line-type plots of Life Expectancy less so.\n\n\n\n\nSuggested Answers to Reflection Questions\n\nThese are concise, indicative answers. Local results may vary slightly depending on plotting parameters and ordering.\n\n\n\nPart A — Load dataset\n\nVariables in state.x77: Population (thousands), Income (per-capita, USD), Illiteracy (% age ≥25 illiterate), Life.Exp (years), Murder (per 100,000), HS.Grad (% high-school graduates), Frost (mean days ≤ 0°C), Area (square miles).\n\nPlanning relevance: population size/density, income, education, crime, longevity connect to regional disparities and regeneration priorities.\n\n\n\nPart B — Data exploration\n\nDimensions: 50 rows × 8 columns.\n\nAll columns are numeric/continuous; state names are row names (categorical identifier).\n\n\n\nPart C — Head/Tail\n\nEarly vs late rows simply reflect alphabetical state ordering; no time component. Values vary widely (e.g., Area, Population).\n\n\n\nPart D — Descriptive statistics\n\nWidest spreads typically in Area and Population (large range, right-skew).\n\nMurder and Illiteracy show noticeable skew and outliers.\n\n\n\nPart E — Graphics help\n\nUseful base functions: pairs(), boxplot(), hist(), barplot(), stripchart(), dotchart(), qqnorm()/qqline().\n\n\n\nPart F — Single column plot (Population)\n\nStrong right-skew: a few very populous states (CA, NY, TX) vs many smaller states. Outliers at the high end.\n\n\n\nPart G — Scatter (Income vs Illiteracy)\n\nClear negative association: higher income correlates with lower illiteracy.\n\nSome states deviate from the trend but pattern holds overall.\n\n\n\nPart H — pairs() of entire dataset\n\nNotable patterns often seen:\n\nIncome ↑ with HS.Grad and Life.Exp.\n\nMurder tends to be higher where Illiteracy is higher and HS.Grad is lower.\n\nArea weakly related to socio-economic outcomes (size ≠ prosperity).\n\n\n\n\nPart I — Types “b” vs “h” (Life.Exp)\n\ntype=\"b\" conveys point-to-point variability; type=\"h\" emphasizes magnitudes from baseline.\n\nFor life expectancy, \"b\" is generally clearer.\n\n\n\nPart J — Help\n\nExamples of useful args: pch (point symbol), cex (size), col (colour), xlim/ylim (ranges), main/sub (titles/subtitles).\n\n\n\nPart K — Labels and titles (Income)\n\nBetter labels: x = “State (index)”, y = “Per-capita income (USD)”, title = “Per-capita income by state”.\n\nColour is decorative here unless encoding a grouping.\n\n\n\nPart L — Horizontal bar plot (Murder)\n\nStates with higher values stand out (exact names depend on ordering). For rigorous identification, sort with order() or use a dotchart.\n\n\n\nPart M — Vertical bar plot (Illiteracy)\n\nHelps compare education disparities. Policy angle: target states with highest illiteracy for adult education and schooling investment.\n\n\n\nPart N — Histogram (Income)\n\nTypically unimodal, mild right-skew. Most states cluster around mid-income; a few richer states in the right tail. Bin choice affects apparent shape.\n\n\n\nPart O — Boxplot (Life.Exp)\n\nMedian around ~70 years, relatively tight IQR; lower outliers indicate states with comparatively worse health outcomes.\n\n\n\nPart P — Multiple boxplots\n\nPopulation shows largest spread; Life.Exp the tightest. Outliers are more common in Murder and Illiteracy.\n\n\n\nPart Q — Grid of charts\n\nMost informative: scatterplots for relationships (e.g., Income vs Illiteracy), and boxplots/histograms for distributions.\n\nLeast informative: unsorted barplots of continuous variables.\n\n\n\nBest practices — summaries\n\nInspect structure first; match plot to variable type; label clearly; avoid misleading encodings; explore visually before modelling.\n\nEnd of Lab 4",

    "text": "Lab 6 — Using GitHub Copilot in RStudio\n\nGoal\nLearn to use GitHub Copilot inside RStudio to speed up routine coding, while staying in control of quality, privacy, and reproducibility.\n\n\n\nLearning outcomes\nBy the end you will be able to: 1. Enable and sign into GitHub Copilot in RStudio. 2. Accept, reject, or modify Copilot autocomplete suggestions effectively. 3. Use comment-first prompting to steer suggestions. 4. Diagnose and fix typical Copilot mistakes (wrong column names, redundant args, etc.). 5. Apply safe-use practices (privacy, determinism, avoiding “vibe coding”).\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\nR (≥ 4.3 recommended) and RStudio (a recent version with Copilot support).\nA GitHub account with Copilot access (student/educator plans are available).\nPackages: tidyverse, palmerpenguins, readxl, ggplot2.\n\ninstall.packages(c(\"tidyverse\", \"palmerpenguins\", \"readxl\", \"ggplot2\"))\n\nNote: Column names for the penguins dataset may differ depending on source. Treat this as a feature to practice Copilot-aware debugging.\n\n\n\n\nPart A — Set up Copilot in RStudio (10–15 min)\n\nOpen RStudio → Tools → Global Options → Copilot.\nEnable GitHub Copilot and sign in with GitHub.\nCreate a new R Script (File → New File → R Script).\nType some characters to see ghost text suggestions.\n\nTab to accept, Esc to dismiss, or keep typing to ignore.\n\n\n\n\nReflection A\nExplain in one sentence the difference between ghost text and code you’ve actually inserted.\n\n\n\nPart B — First suggestions with ggplot2 (20 min)\nWe’ll use penguins to practice.\n\nAdd a guiding comment:\n\n# Task: scatter plot of bill length (x) vs body mass (y), colour by species\n\nStart a plot:\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n# library(palmerpenguins)\n# penguins &lt;- palmerpenguins::penguins\n\np &lt;- ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, colour = species)) +\n  geom_point()\n\nRun and, if errors occur, inspect:\n\nglimpse(penguins)\nnames(penguins)\n\nFix names if needed (bill_length_mm → bill_len).\n\n\n\nMini-exercises\n\nAdd title, caption, and axis labels:\n\n# Add a title, caption, and nicer axis labels\n\nAdd smoother:\n\n# Add a loess smoother without confidence band\n\n\nReflection B\nWhen is Copilot faster? When slower?\n\n\n\nPart C — Comment-first prompting for histograms (15 min)\n\nAdd a guiding comment:\n\n# Histogram of body mass by species, overlapping with transparency and an accessible palette\n\nInspect Copilot’s suggestion, remove redundant arguments, and adjust to:\n\ngeom_histogram(position = \"identity\", alpha = 0.5)\n\nCommit the cleaned version.\n\n\n\nReflection C\nReplace colour with fill, adjust legend, apply minimal theme.\n\n\n\nPart D — Loading local data safely (10–15 min)\nCopilot does not know your file system.\n\nSave Scooby.xlsx in a data/ folder.\nLoad explicitly:\n\nlibrary(readxl)\nscooby &lt;- read_xlsx(\"data/Scooby.xlsx\")\n\nAdd prompt:\n\n# Quick EDA: glimpse, summary, and count episodes by network\n\nEdit Copilot’s code before running.\n\n\n\nReflection D\nWhy be explicit with data loading and library imports?\n\n\n\nPart E — Boxplots (15 min)\nVisualise IMDb ratings by network.\n\nPrompt:\n\n# Boxplot of IMDb (y) by network (x); tilt x labels; use fill instead of colour\n\nEdit column names if needed.\nAdd improvements:\n\n# Make it horizontal, tidy legend, and add labs\n\n\nExtension E\nOrder networks by median rating.\n\n\n\nPart F — Best practices\n\nPrivacy: Never expose credentials/confidential data.\nNon-determinism: Review suggestions before accepting.\nNo vibe coding: Don’t accept what you don’t understand.\nContext helps: Use clean code and comments.\nReproducibility: Remove redundant args, consider renv.\n\ninstall.packages(\"renv\")\nrenv::init()\n\n\n\nPart G — Check-off & submission\n\nCopilot enabled and signed in.\nOne scatter plot (corrected column names).\nOne histogram (transparency + accessible palette).\nOne boxplot (labels/theme improved).\nReflection paragraph on Copilot.\n\nExport script or Quarto doc → submit.\n\n\n\nTA rubric\n\nSetup (10%): Copilot enabled; script compiles.\nCode quality (40%): Reviewed/edited suggestions; correct names.\nVisuals (30%): Clear labels, sensible themes.\nReflection (20%): Insightful, acknowledges limits.\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nSuggestions not appearing? Check Global Options → Copilot.\nWrong dataset/columns? Run names()/glimpse().\nOverconfident code? Scale back, test small steps.\n\n\n\n\nFurther practice\n\nRewrite prompts as comments for grouped summaries, joins, faceted plots.\nCompare Copilot vs manual solutions.\nTry Quarto docs where each chunk begins with a comment.\n\n\nEnd of lab",
