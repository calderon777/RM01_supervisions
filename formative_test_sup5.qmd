# Formative Assessment Task (Based on Supervision 6)

This formative task prepares you for the assessed empirical report due later in the module.  
Your goal is to **write a short analytical report** based on the content, workflow, and outputs of **Supervision 6 (Logit vs Probit Models)**.

You will submit your answer through **Microsoft Forms**:

## 🎯 Task Overview

Using the material covered in **Supervision 6** (Logit vs Probit modelling on the hedonic dataset), produce a **concise research-style report** of **300–450 words** that addresses the following:

### **1. Model Setup**
Describe:
- How the dependent variable was transformed into a binary indicator (High vs Low Price).
- Why Logit and Probit models are appropriate for this transformed outcome.
- The rationale for keeping the hedonic RHS variables from Supervision 5.

### **2. Model Estimation**
Summarise:
- The two models estimated (Logit and Probit).
- The use of **backward selection with BIC** to obtain the final specification.
- Any key differences between the BIC-selected Logit and Probit models (e.g., dropped covariates).

### **3. Interpretation of Results**
Explain:
- The meaning of *marginal effects* in probability terms.
- Identify **one or two** variables with strong and statistically significant effects and interpret them concisely.

### **4. Predictive Performance**
Discuss:
- How ROC curves and AUC were used to compare predictive accuracy.
- Whether the Logit and Probit models produced similar predicted probabilities.
- What threshold choice means for classification (using confusion matrices).

### **5. Final Reflection**
Provide a short reflection (2–3 sentences) on:
- Which model you would prefer for predicting high-price houses.
- Whether statistical performance or interpretability guided your preference.

## 📝 Notes for Students

- This is **not** a coding task — focus on interpretation and communication.
- Keep your report structured, clear, and evidence-based.
- Use your own words and avoid copying directly from supervision notes.
- Aim for short, well-argued paragraphs rather than long technical descriptions.
