## Overview

This document provides the **solutions** to:

> **Formative Test 1 – Linear Regression MCQs**

The quiz was delivered via **MS Forms** and focuses on R, simple linear regression, model diagnostics, and basic time series concepts.

---

## Questions and Answers

### 1. In R, which function reads a CSV file into a data frame?

**Correct answer:** `read.csv()`

---

### 2. AR(1) model:

**Correct answer:**  
An **autoregressive model of order 1**, where the current value depends on its own first lag, typically written as:

\[
y_t = c + \phi y_{t-1} + u_t
\]

---

### 3. The Durbin–Watson test detects:

**Correct answer:** Autocorrelation

---

### 4. Endogeneity can arise due to:

**Correct answer:** Omitted variables

---

### 5. A fitted regression line always passes through:

**Correct answer:** The mean of X and Y (the point \((\bar X, \bar Y)\))

---

### 6. A negative slope suggests:

**Correct answer:** Y decreases as X increases

---

### 7. The AIC is:

**Correct answer:** Model quality penalizing complexity

---

### 8. What does `geom_point()` add to a ggplot?

**Correct answer:** Scatter plot points

---

### 9. In a simple regression, what does the slope represent?

**Correct answer:** The change in Y for a one-unit change in X

---

### 10. In ggplot2, which function can be used to add a regression line to a scatter plot?

**Correct answer:** `geom_smooth(method = "lm")`

---

### 11. Which function fits a linear model in R?

**Correct answer:** `lm()`

---

### 12. If X = income and Y = food expenditure, what does a slope of 0.4 mean?

**Correct answer:**  
For every £1 increase in income, food expenditure rises by £0.40

---

### 13. Which dplyr function filters rows?

**Correct answer:** `filter()`

---

### 14. A p-value of 0.01 suggests:

**Correct answer:** Strong evidence against the null

---

### 15. Multicollinearity is:

**Correct answer:** A problem in multiple regression, not simple regression

---

### 16. Which function fits a linear model in R?

**Correct answer:** `lm()`

---

### 17. When the regression line fits perfectly, the residuals are:

**Correct answer:** All zero

---

### 18. What happens to R-squared when adding more variables?

**Correct answer:** It always increases or stays the same

---

### 19. When `summary(fit)` shows `Pr(>|t|) < 0.05`, we:

**Correct answer:** Reject the null hypothesis that \(\beta = 0\)

---

### 20. In ggplot2, which function adds points to a plot?

**Correct answer:** `geom_point()`

---

### 21. Adjusted R-squared is preferred when:

**Correct answer:** Comparing models with different numbers of predictors

---

### 22. If residuals show a pattern, it suggests:

**Correct answer:** Model misspecification

---

### 23. Residuals represent:

**Correct answer:** The difference between observed and predicted Y

---

### 24. Stationarity means:

**Correct answer:** Constant mean and variance

---

### 25. Which command displays the regression results summary in R?

**Correct answer:** `summary()`

---

### 26. Why do we add `method = "lm"` inside `geom_smooth()`?

**Correct answer:** To fit a linear model line

---

### 27. In `lm(food ~ income)`, “food” is the:

**Correct answer:** Dependent variable

---

### 28. In a scatter plot with a fitted regression line, large vertical deviations indicate:

**Correct answer:** Large residuals

---

### 29. Heteroskedasticity refers to:

**Correct answer:** Non-constant error variance

---

### 30. One key assumption of OLS is that errors have:

**Correct answer:** All choices are correct  
(Zero mean, constant variance, and no correlation with X.)

---

### 31. If residuals are not normally distributed, this mainly affects:

**Correct answer:** The validity of hypothesis tests

---

### 32. What does a high R-squared value indicate about the model fit?

**Correct answer:** The model explains a large proportion of the variance in Y

---

### 33. What is the null hypothesis for the slope coefficient in simple regression?

**Correct answer:** \(\beta_1 = 0\)
